 * by calling @ref native_posix_802154_src_matching_method:
 *   - For Thread: @ref NATIVE_POSIX_802154_SRC_ADDR_MATCH_THREAD -- The pending bit
 *                          is set only for the addresses found in the list.
 *   - For Zigbee: @ref NATIVE_POSIX_802154_SRC_ADDR_MATCH_ZIGBEE -- The pending bit
 *                  is cleared only for the short addresses found in the list.
 *     This method does not set pending bit in non-command and non-data-request
 *     frames.
 *   - For standard-compliant implementation:
 *      @ref NATIVE_POSIX_802154_SRC_ADDR_MATCH_ALWAYS_1 -- The pending bit is always
 *      set to 1.
 *     This requires an empty data frame with AR set to 0 to be transmitted
 *     immediately afterwards.
