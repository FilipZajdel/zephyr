 * @brief Verifies if the given part of the frame is valid.
 *
 * This function is called a few times for each received frame. The first call
 * is after the FCF is received (PSDU length is 2 and @p p_num_bytes value
 * is 3). The subsequent calls are performed when the number of bytes requested
 * by the previous call is available. The iteration ends when the function does
 * not request any more bytes to check. If the verified part of the function is
 * correct, this function returns true and sets @p p_num_bytes to the number of
 * bytes that should be available in PSDU during the next iteration. If the
 * frame is correct and there is nothing more to check, this function returns
 * true and does not modify the @p p_num_bytes value. If the verified frame is
 * incorrect, this function returns false and the @p p_num_bytes value is
 * undefined.
 *
 * @param[in]    p_data       Pointer to a buffer that contains PHR and PSDU of
 *                            the incoming frame.
 * @param[inout] p_num_bytes  Number of bytes available in @p p_data buffer.
 *                            This value is either set to the requested number
 *                            of bytes for the next iteration or remains
 *                            unchanged if no more iterations are to be
 *                            performed during the filtering of the given
 *                            frame.

 * @retval NATIVE_POSIX_802154_RX_ERROR_NONE               Verified part of the incoming
 *                                                frame is valid.
 * @retval NATIVE_POSIX_802154_RX_ERROR_INVALID_FRAME      Verified part of the incoming
 *                                                frame is invalid.
 * @retval NATIVE_POSIX_802154_RX_ERROR_INVALID_DEST_ADDR  Incoming frame has
 *                                                destination address that
 *                                                mismatches the address of
 *                                                this node.
